# Hybrid-GNN-Transformer-Example
This repository contains the sample code used to demonstrate the Hybrid GNN-Transformer Architecture

The two datasets used- course_catalog.csv and student_data.csv, were artificially generated. They are used as proof of concept for this architecture and do not necessarily reflect real-world trends. Feel free to experiment with your own graph structured data and feature sets. 

I have not experimented with more than one feature set at the concatenation stage, but to do so would not be overly complicated. 

To use this demo, install requirements.txt into your preferred virtual environment. I used an anaconda environment and loaded it as a kernal in VSCode to run the Jupyter Notebook. 

To get started in anaconda, create a new environment (I used Python 3.10.14) and run:

cd your/location/for/this/project
pip install -r requirements.txt

You can run the notebook however you would like, but my preference was to use this environment as my kernal in VSCode. 

If you experiment with it and find anything cool, feel free to reach out! I would appreciate hearing feedback and any use cases you found for this architecture.
